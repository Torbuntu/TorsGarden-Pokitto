# TorsGarden-Pokitto
A garden simulator game for Pokitto


Gameplay:

|Tool|Use|
|----|----|
|Hoe |Tills earth and clears dead plants for planting new seeds|
|Seed|Seeds are purchaced and sometimes dropped by harvesting plants. They are used to plant more plants|
|Watering Can|For watering plants|
|----|----|

Plants:

|Stage|notes|
|----|----|
|Seed|Doesn't need pest control, but requires water or it will die|
|Plant1|Just a sprout, but now requires pest control as well as water|
|Plant2|Leaves form, attracting more pests|
|Plant3|The harvestable crops begin to form|
|Harvest|The plant is ready to be harvested|

Note: To keep it very simple and basic, all plants follow the same stage patterns. They will only differ in duration of growth, and needs for water.

Land:
The farm land is a grid of farmable plots of unlockable land. In order to plant a seed, the land must be cleared (if a dead crop exists) and tilled (with the hoe)


- Start: 
Player begins with a small sum of `coin`, `seeds` and a single unlocked plot of land with a dead plant on it.

- Semi-tutorial:
Player must learn to use the Hoe to clear the dead plant. Where then player plants a seed for a start of a new crop.

- Main Game:
Player plants, waters, and harvests plants to gain items for sale. Selling items gives coin to buy more seeds, upgrade (to tools), or unlock plots of land to grow more crops at a time. 

- Winning:
The idea is to just keep playing. But ideally once all land is unlocked, all tools upgraded fully, and coin is maxed out (if possible) then that is pretty much end game (potential for an award like an on screen trophy)
