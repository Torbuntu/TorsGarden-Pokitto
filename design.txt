Tor's Garden - Game Brainstorm

3x3 garden grid. User will start with a plant. 

plants can have types (flower, veggie, fruit, etc...)

Plant types can determine difficulty and "work" to grow to full maturity.

Mini Games:

The main way to improve plants is through minigames.

Minigames can be triggered in different ways. 

Some are randomly spawned (weeds, insects)

Some are manually triggered with tools (Digging for planting, Pruning, harvest)

ideas:
- Dig the right size plot for the plant (The more accurate the plot, the better fitting the plant, 
the higher quality overall.
- Swatting Insetcs.
- Weeding.
- Pruning.
- Harvesting.

- Zen Garden?
